Kanye previews ‘Graduation’

2007-06-03 | Greg Kot | *Chicago Tribune*

Kanye West’s third album, “Graduation,” isn’t due out till summer’s end, but the Grammy-winning, multimillion-selling rapper-producer is already leaking studio tracks on the Internet.

A batch of new West material has surfaced on a 25-track mix tape assembled by the producer. “Can’t Tell Me Nothing (The Official Mixtape)” includes “Us Placers,” a collaboration with rappers Lupe Fiasco and Pharrell Williams, billing themselves as CRS. Thom Yorke’s “The Eraser,” the title track from the Radiohead singer’s 2006 solo album, serves as an eerie backdrop for a meditation on the lure of wealth, the perils of fame and the cruelty of fate. The three rappers’ verses are loosely organized around Yorke’s haunting refrain: “The more you try to erase me, the more that I appear.”

Fiasco flexes his relaxed, yet rapid-fire flow to set the scene: a picture of opulence that appears like a mirage, then dissipates. “All the money in the world don’t make it painless,” he declares.

West brings his South Side twang to bear on a verse about artists who nearly make the big time, then fade into obscurity. Williams finishes the track with a surreal series of images that reference the recent Virginia Tech massacre: “I wonder how God is going to paint today’s canvasses, cause who knew that day that man would go to V-A with a Tec to spray campuses.”

Though West is a major-label recording artist, he has consistently leaked his music to the public through back-channel mix tapes, a burgeoning underground source for breaking new artists and laying the groundwork for new releases by established rappers. West floated his breakthrough song “Through the Wire” on the Internet long before it officially surfaced on his 2004 debut album, “The College Dropout.”

It’s unclear if “Us Placers” will wind up on “Graduation,” but it’s already shaping up as an Internet hit in a class with “George Bush Doesn’t Care About Black People,” in which the Houston rap group the Legendary K.O. riffed on West’s nationally televised remarks in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

“Can’t Tell Me Nothing” is one of thousands of mix CDs that will surface this year on the underground market. Established artists such as West continue to release music on these free CDs because they can drop their guard, test new sounds, expose upcoming talent and experiment without the pressure of mainstream scrutiny.

The mix-CD also serves as an advertisement for “Graduation” and the forthcoming West-produced album by fellow South Side rapper Common, “Finding Forever.” West offers a snippet of a forthcoming single, “Stronger.” Common previews his upcoming single, “The People,” a showcase for his deft rhyming skills but breaking little new ground sonically with its “70s soul-dusties feel. More impressive is the churning “Southside,” a collaboration with West in which they reminisce about their shared history growing up in Chicago, and “The Game,” a syncopated dissection of hip-hop careerism.

West also endorses a rising Chicago rapper, Kid Sister, by adding a cameo vocal to a remixed version of her single “Pro Nails” and appropriates “Young Folks,” the whistle-driven hit by Swedish rock band Peter Bjorn and John, to discourse on the media.

West chastises journalists for misquoting and exploiting him.

But in the same monologue he acknowledges, “I was halfway out of my mind the past two years ... I was off that drug called fame.” Since then, “I’ve calmed down and come back down to earth.”

West echoes those sentiments in “Can’t Tell Me Nothing,” another meditation on fame. The rapper is by turns defiant, defensive, rueful, sarcastic and deadly passionate. Above all, he sounds impatient with the world and with himself. No wonder he puts out so much music.
