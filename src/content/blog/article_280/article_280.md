“Coldest Winter”

2008-11-13 | Caryn Ganz | *Rolling Stone*

Welcome to the winter of Kanye’s discontent. On the first two singles from the upcoming 808s and Heartbreak, West drenched his sorrows in AutoTune, but he’s more clear-voiced on this ode to his late mother. Injecting the glowing synths of Tears for Fears’ “Memories Fade” with gut-punching percussion, he croons, “Will I ever love again?” It’s an honest sentiment that’s fortunately not deep enough to drown in.
