# Kanye vs. Taylor

Taylor Swift is never one to shy away from speaking her mind. But minutes after Kanye West interrupted her Best Female Video acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, declaring that Beyoncé Knowles should have won instead for "Single Ladies," the singer simply stood on stage, stunned. "She heard the boos and thought maybe the audience agreed with him," a Swift source says. Tears glistening in her eyes, she then dashed backstage and reacted like any other 19-year-old would. Says a witness, "She burst into tears. She was very emotional."

Little did Swift realize that the incident - watched by almost 9 million people - was the moment in which she went UOITI music prodigy to beloved superstar. Her peers inside NYC's Radio City Music Hall not only gave her a standing ovation but vilified West. When the rapper, 32, returned to his seat, Pink "walked by and shook her head in disgust," a source says. (Per MTVs request, security escorted West out, along with girlfriend Amber Rose.) Meanwhile, everyone from Dane Cook to Adam Lambert took to Twitter and blogs to cheer for Team Taylor. "Artists she's never met were calling and e-mailing," the Swift source notes. "She won everyone's heart."

As did Knowles. After accepting Video of the Year honors, the singer, 28, bypassed her own thank-you and instead brought Swift back to the stage to finish her speech. "It was all her decision," Knowles' dad and manager, Matthew Knowles, tells G?-. "She's a genuinely good person." (Jay-Z's reaction? "He thought Kanye was just being Kanye. But he was so proud of Beyoncé for making everything better," says the source of her husband, who missed the incident.) The act of gratitude was not lost on Swift, who was more upbeat speaking backstage after the show. "It was so wonderful and gracious of her," Swift told Us, adding, "Everybody's been really nice. It's definitely been an interesting night."

## Backstage Drama

That said, this was not how Swift had envisioned the event. Celebrating her VMA nomination and her three-times-platinum CD Fearless, the night should have been a fairytale - she even arrived in a horse-drawn carriage! But after receiving the first award for her "You Belong With Me" video, she was visibly unnerved when West - whom she had never met - rushed the stage, grabbed the microphone and proclaimed that "Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." What was Swift thinking? "I was really excited because I had just won an award, and then I was really excited because Kanye was on stage," she told Us. "And then I wasn't so excited anymore after that."

She was devastated, to be more precise. "She was crying backstage and everyone was surrounding her, trying to comfort her," an eyewitness says. "I think for her to go from such a high to such a low was a roller coaster of emotions." Still, Swift pulled herself together quickly: Less than 10 minutes later, she had to perform live from the streets of NYC. (Parts of her song were pretaped.) "She was trying to process everything and had no time to really get upset," a source says. "After she was done, she tried to keep it together but just broke down."

Behind the scenes, MTV staffers were unsure how to handle the jaw-dropping moment. "Everybody was in shock," a source says. "They were just standing back. It was surreal." But as Swift holed up in her dressing room with her mom, Andrea, artists rushed to offer words of encouragement - including Eminem, who asked execs if he could summon Swift on stage during his own acceptance speech. "He felt bad about it," the MTV source tells Us. "But he was told that Knowles was going to do it, because it was more fitting." In fact, Swift's rep tells Us that Knowles (who knew in advance that she would take the top trophy) tried to reach out to Swift during the first commercial break after West's rant. "Logistically, it was difficult for Beyoncé to talk to her, so her sister, Solange, spoke to Taylor's manager and said she was so sorry and that her kid was a huge Taylor fan," the rep says. Matthew then spoke to Swift in her dressing room and asked if she wanted to return to the stage. She agreed - and gave her shout-outs in the show's final minutes. A private chat between Swift and Knowles followed, says a Knowles source: "It was a pep talk. Beyoncé told her she knows Taylor is strong and gifted and would make it through."

## Why He Did It

West, of course, has practically made a second career out of bizarre outbursts see box at left). What sparked this round? On the red carpet, he was spotted chugging a bottle of Hennessy cognac. (An eyewitness says a quarter of the bottle was drained by the time he entered the venue.) 'Yes, he had a little to drink," a West insider tells Us. But the source adds that the rapper was sincere in his beliefs: "He considers Beyoncé a sister, and there is just something about these awards shows that gets him worked up."

But even West's mea culpa - delivered in a frantic allcaps message on his blog - drew controversy. Though he apologized ("I'm SOOOOO SORRY") and mentioned that he had personally spoken to Swift's mom post-rant, he reiterated that Knowles' video was "THE BEST OF THIS DECADE!!!!" (The post was later replaced with a more heartfelt message.) A Swift source says it was, in fact, Andrea who confronted West. "She told him it was an unwarranted attack and if he ever has children maybe he'll understand how she feels," the source says, adding that West replied by defending Knowles' video. "For him to make it sound like he apologized is so not the way it went down." (A source close to West insists he did, saying, "He feels he is always misunderstood.")

A day later, West tried to make amends again, on NBC's The Jay Leno Show, where he admitted, "It's actually someone's emotions that I stepped on ___ I'd like to apologize to her in person." He also hinted that his mother's 2007 death had left him in pain with no time to process it. "I'm just ashamed that my hurt caused someone else's hurt," he said.

## The Aftermath

Ever the belle of the ball, Swift was all smiles when she arrived to a post-awards dinner at Del Frisco's at midnight and was met with a standing ovation. "Taylor's friends ordered her favorite dish, macaroni and cheese, to cheer her up," a source says. "And nobody brought up Kanye West." (Across town, more support: When a West song played at club Avenue, Justin Timberlake took the mie and shouted, 'You might as well play Taylor Swift right now.")

Though the singer is overwhelmed by support (Janet Jackson is just one of the celebs who have sent flowers, a source says), Swift is doing her best to put the flap behind her. "She's OK" a source says. "Taylor is not someone who enjoys being the victim, so she had to get over it pretty quickly. She just wants to get on with work and for this to be over."
