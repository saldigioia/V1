# Watch the Throne Tour: the Protean Monster That Set Paris Ablaze
## Jay-Z and Kanye West Defended Their Joint Album on the Bercy Stage This Friday, Before Two More Parisian Dates. Are the Two Heavyweight Rappers the Masters of the World?
2012-06-02 | Marie Le Douaran & Mathilde Laurelli | *l’express*
this Friday, Bercy Hosted the First Parisian Stop of the Watch the Throne Tour, the Tour of Jay-Z and Kanye West. It Was a Three-Hour Grandiose Show on Multiple Stages Facing an Enraptured Audience, Led at Times by the Two Rappers Together, at Times by Just One of the Two Figures.
### We Really Liked…
from the Second Track of the Setlist, “who Gon’ Stop Me”, the Audience Is Dazzled by the Lighting Effects of the Bling-Religious Staging. Like a Divine Apparition, a Blue Laser Beam Illuminates from the Vault of Bercy the Bodies of Jay-Z and Kanye West, Erected as Icons on Giant Cubes Slowly Rising Into the Air. Haloed in Glory, the Gods of American Rap Glitter in Their Stage Outfits, Created by Riccardo Tisci, the Artistic Director of the Parisian Haute Couture House Givenchy. It’s So Megalomaniacal That We Want More… and They Keep Dazzling Us Throughout the Entire Concert. — *mathilde Laurelli*
kanye West and Jay-Z Deny Themselves Nothing: They Summon Frank Sinatra - “new York, New York”, Justice - “d.a.n.c.e”, Otis Redding - “try a Little Tenderness”… We Also Encounter Ferocious Animals, Flames, Nuclear Explosions, Spotlights, Lasers, Sparks, a Giant Flag, an Encore in the Form of a Record - 11 “niggas in Paris” This Friday… It Goes Off in All Directions, It Shines, It Sweats, and It Has the Charm of Things That Are Deliberately Over the Top. Sometimes, It Calms Down. Kanye West Abandons the Auto-Tune, and That’s Good, Too. —*marie Le Douaran*
### We Didn’t Like as Much…
we Get Bored Quite Quickly With the Videos Broadcast Simultaneously: Starving Cheetahs Attacking an Antelope, a Panther Roaring in the Jungle… It Borders on an Animal Documentary - Snore. Even the Clip For “no Church in the Wild,” Directed by Romain Gavras, Proves to Be Borderline Soporific. We Also Deplore the Overuse of Auto-Tune on Kanye West’s Voice and the Absence of Beyoncé Knowles to Sing “lift Off”. *ml*
the Longer It Is, the Better? not Sure. Because to Hold the Stage For Three Hours, You Need a Very Large Number of Tracks — Nearly 40, Which Go Far Beyond the Scope of Watch the Throne — So Much So That We No Longer Know Who Is in Concert, Jay-Z, Kanye West or the Duo. a Little Less Ego and More Duets Wouldn’t Have Hurt. *mld*
### Verdict
the Survivors of the Mosh Pits — Which Consist of Throwing Oneself Into an Empty Circle Created at the Request of the Rappers During the Encore — Will Surely not Forget the 11 Successive Performances of “niggas in Paris” Chained After Three Hours of the Show. If They Do, a Lost Voice — or a Missing Toe — Will Refresh Their Memory the Next Day! *ml* 
it Would Be a Shame to Miss This Performance, Especially Since an Additional Date Has Been Added, June 18. If Only For the — Too Rare — Moments of Complicity on Stage Between the Two Kings, Who Do Their Best to Share the Throne Equitably. *mld*"

# Watch The Throne Tour: The Protean Monster That Set Paris Ablaze

## Jay-Z and Kanye West defended their joint album on the Bercy stage this Friday, before two more Parisian dates. Are the two heavyweight rappers the masters of the world?

2012-06-02 | Marie Le Douaran & Mathilde Laurelli | *L’Express*

This Friday, Bercy hosted the first Parisian stop of the Watch The Throne Tour, the tour of Jay-Z and Kanye West. It was a three-hour grandiose show on multiple stages facing an enraptured audience, led at times by the two rappers together, at times by just one of the two figures.

### We really liked…

From the second track of the setlist, “Who Gon’ Stop Me”, the audience is dazzled by the lighting effects of the bling-religious staging. Like a divine apparition, a blue laser beam illuminates from the vault of Bercy the bodies of Jay-Z and Kanye West, erected as icons on giant cubes slowly rising into the air. Haloed in glory, the gods of American rap glitter in their stage outfits, created by Riccardo Tisci, the artistic director of the Parisian haute couture house Givenchy. It’s so megalomaniacal that we want more… and they keep dazzling us throughout the entire concert. — *Mathilde Laurelli*

Kanye West and Jay-Z deny themselves nothing: they summon Frank Sinatra - “New York, New York”, Justice - “D.A.N.C.E”, Otis Redding - “Try a Little Tenderness”… We also encounter ferocious animals, flames, nuclear explosions, spotlights, lasers, sparks, a giant flag, an encore in the form of a record - 11 “Niggas in Paris” this Friday… It goes off in all directions, it shines, it sweats, and it has the charm of things that are deliberately over the top. Sometimes, it calms down. Kanye West abandons the auto-tune, and that’s good, too. —*Marie Le Douaran*

### We didn’t like as much…

We get bored quite quickly with the videos broadcast simultaneously: starving cheetahs attacking an antelope, a panther roaring in the jungle… It borders on an animal documentary - snore. Even the clip for “No Church in the Wild,” directed by Romain Gavras, proves to be borderline soporific. We also deplore the overuse of auto-tune on Kanye West’s voice and the absence of Beyoncé Knowles to sing “Lift Off”. *ML*

The longer it is, the better? Not sure. Because to hold the stage for three hours, you need a very large number of tracks — nearly 40, which go far beyond the scope of Watch The Throne — so much so that we no longer know who is in concert, Jay-Z, Kanye West or the duo. A little less ego and more duets wouldn’t have hurt. *MLD*

### Verdict

The survivors of the mosh pits — which consist of throwing oneself into an empty circle created at the request of the rappers during the encore — will surely not forget the 11 successive performances of “Niggas in Paris” chained after three hours of the show. If they do, a lost voice — or a missing toe — will refresh their memory the next day! *ML* 

It would be a shame to miss this performance, especially since an additional date has been added, June 18. If only for the — too rare — moments of complicity on stage between the two kings, who do their best to share the throne equitably. *MLD*
