# Kanye West, Absolutely.

## As Arrogant as He is Talented, the Young American Rapper is in Concert at the Zenith.

His concerts are as outsized as his ego. For three nights in a row in London, Kanye West, the rapper-producer with two platinum albums, offered a show that at least had the merit of consoling for the price of admission (46 euros). As a conductor, the man who has managed to make himself hated by the entire international press by constantly declaring: “I am great; why shouldn’t I have the right to say it?” leads his eight violinists, two cellists, and his harpist with a baton. A video screen at the back of the stage constantly broadcasts subliminal images (a blue sky with birds flying around) interspersed with equally suggestive messages: “Free your mind, your ass will follow,” “Mock what people say.”

Apart from New Yorkers KRS One or Busta Rhymes, no other rapper sweats as much as he does on stage, especially since Kanye West is alone at the front throughout the show - except for an appearance by singer Keysha Cole. The rapper, who for a long time was behind the successes of Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, and Common, no longer suffers anyone to overshadow him. That doesn’t stop him from covering the songs of those who have inspired him: The Beatles’ Eleanor Rigby, Al Green’s Let’s Stay Together, or even Prince’s When Doves Cry.

Last June, the 28-year-old challenger, who came to promote his new album, The Late Registration, for French journalists, requested complete silence during the listening session (nothing so extraordinary so far) but also forbade them to take notes, at the risk of berating the scribblers at the slightest movement of the pen, saying: “Do you realize the favor I’m doing you? It’s as if Marvin Gaye came to let you listen to What’s Going On in person!”

Since then, his album, which is good, although far from the claimed masterpiece, has achieved great popular success and several awards, thanks to bold tracks such as Goldigger, which pays homage to women who demand to be pampered and refuse to date small earners, or Diamonds Forever, which denounces the exploitation of children in Sierra Leone’s mines.

But that wasn’t enough to calm the anger of the artist from Chicago’s middle class against the press, since he ends his London concert ranting against the “asshole journalists” who call him an egocentric artist. Lying down, a stool under his chest as if he were waiting for the blade of a guillotine, he comments on the articles scrolling on the screen and lashes out at the Rolling Stone journalist who portrays him as a porn addict, on the grounds that he admitted to him his habit of watching such films.

Yet it is in this same article that an interview with Kanye West’s father, an ex-Black Panther who is now a sociology professor, allows us to understand his son: “His boasting, he gets it from his maternal grandfather, Buddy. He was a real fan of Muhammad Ali. For him, that was the best thing to do.” Meaning: convince yourself that you’re the best in the world to unsettle your opponent and win all your matches. 

Fortunately, Kanye West doesn’t just have Ali’s big mouth, he also knows how to take courageous stands. He was notably the first to castigate the attitude of the American government and the media after the passage of Hurricane Katrina, during a Telethon broadcast by NBC, by launching his “Bush doesn’t care about black people”. Recently, at the risk of burning bridges with his colleagues, Kanye West denounced the homophobia of the rap world, after discovering that his cousin was gay. There may be a big heart behind that big mouth.
